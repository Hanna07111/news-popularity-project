# Project Title
Predicting the Popularity of Online News

## üìå Overview
- **Course**: Pattern Recognition (2025 spring, 8th semester)
- **Objective**: Develop a binary classification model to predict whether an online news article will be popular.
- **Duration**: 2025.04 ~ 2025.07 
- **Individaul/Team**: Team 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **Languages/Frameworks**: Python
- **Data**: News dataset with approximately 47 variables
- **Tools**: Google colaboratory

## üìä Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Outlier handling, missing value imputation, categorical variable encoding, and feature selection  
- **Compare Baseline Models**: Performance comparison of single models, including Decision Tree, Neural Network, XGBoost, and LightGBM  
- **Ensemble**: Attempted ensemble methods based on XGBoost, which showed the best performance among baseline models  
- **Results/Findings**: The ensemble of LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost achieved the best performance  

## üôã Contribution
